Note: I set all largeGivenSmall prob that is larger than 1 to 1.
PLEASE read uncovered ratio first to know the definition of range and uncovered ratio.
STRONGLY RECOMMEND you to install matlab even not to write code but to run and see the results. It's really tedious to screenshot so many images.

the larger the range, the smaller the uncovered ratio, but the bigger the error of largeGivenSmall.
In the extreme case, the probability distribution is not at all similar to the truth, but the uncovered ratio is smaller.
largeGivenSmall, whatever the range, always have much smaller error along the diagonal. Is it true the probability is always more accurate if the corresponding frequency is large(in division, it's less abnormal).
How could the range correlate with the maxDisparity?
In some cases, increasing the range wouldn't cause the uncover ratio to drop.
