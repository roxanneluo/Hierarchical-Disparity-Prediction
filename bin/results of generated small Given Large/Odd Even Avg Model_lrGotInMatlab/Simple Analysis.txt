WHEN RANGE = 4, THE UNCOVERED RATIO IS ALWAYS 0!
Note: I set all largeGivenSmall prob that is larger than 1 to 1.
PLEASE read uncovered ratio first to know the definition of range and uncovered ratio.

the larger the range, the smaller the uncovered ratio, but the bigger the error of largeGivenSmall.
In the extreme case, the probability distribution is not at all similar to the truth, but the uncovered ratio is 0.
largeGivenSmall, whatever the range, always have much smaller error along the diagonal. Is it true the probability is always more accurate if the corresponding frequency is large(in division, it's less abnormal).
How could the range correlate with the maxDisparity?
